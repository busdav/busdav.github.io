## Summary

High noon! Whereas during Blocjams and Blocjams Angular, I had been guided through the development step by step, it was now time to put to use what I'd learned during those projects, and implement new features without step-by-step guidance.

## Explanation

The goal of the Bloc Chat project was to make me build an SPA real-time chat app using AngularJS and Firebase. I could again count on my patient mentor Dalibor to help me out wherever needed and keep me on track.

## Problem

It was not time to apply what I'd learned, I learnt with shock during the first checkpoint. There wasn't any step-by-step instruction anymore. The instruction was simply, "We need a feature allowing for new chat messages to be sent - build the respective templates and controllers." After the initial shock, and looking at what I had learnt before, I slowly realized that I actually did know how to implement the required features. Did it take me a long time? Yes, absolutely. Would any 8-year old with programming experience have been faster? Probably. Did I enjoy it as hell? You bet.

## Solution

Trying, testing, trying, testing. I know. At some point, I should get into TDDâ€¦but we're talking beginnings here. I not only learnt how to write my own controllers, templates, services, and directives, but also how to integrate Firebase, UI Bootstrap, the Angular Cookies module, and much more.

## Results

Well - in the end it worked! I was able to show my friends the first little chat application that basically I had built from scratch.

## Conclusion

The incredulous joy of being able to build something with skills that you have just recently been able to acquire is hard to beat.
