## Summary

Now that I had acquired the basics of front-end programming, through the Blocjams Angular project, I was introduced to the AngularJS framework. I took over the basic structure of the Blocjams app, and refactored it using the AngularJS framework.

## Explanation

The goal of this project was not to build a new application, but rather to refactor the existing Bloc Jams music player app using AngularJS. This allowed to highlight the differences in approach building an application simply using HTML/CSS/JS as opposed to taking advantage of a framework.

## Problem

Being still new and still walking with shaky legs when it came to programming, I was now introduced to the AngularJS framework. "How different can it really be?", I asked myself going into the project. Well, very, it turns out. Of course, the coding fundamentals and the use of the languages are still the same, but the approach is completely different. AngularJS practically being an MVC beast, I needed to think differently about how to tackle building the app.

## Solution

This time: reading. The concepts introduced during this project were too vast in order to be covered in the checkpoints of the curriculum alone. Therefore, willy-nilly I had to dive deep into the AngularJS documentation. I learned about modules, dependency injection, data binding, declarative programming, providers, services, controllers, directives, states, and templates.

## Results

The results of not going too fast with this project, and instead, really trying to understand the concepts, mostly showed in the next project, Bloc Chat - I was able to write an AngularJS application from scratch almost on my own!

## Conclusion

I've realized one thing after my second project already: the coding journey will never end. Not least in the sense that, the learning will never end. Fascinating. What I like about coding as opposed to law is that it is skills-based, rather than knowledge-based. You need to know how to solve problems, not just the content of the law. Granted, that applies to both areas. However, in my personal experience, more to programming.
