## Summary

Blocjams is the first project I've ever worked on. The goal for me was to learn to build with HTML, CSS and JS, using a real-life project - a simple music player.

## Explanation

Blocjams was the first frontend project in the web developer curriculum of Bloc.io - a fully online program to teach people like me with no pre-existing coding experience how to code. While building a music player step by step, I was introduced to the fundamentals of building with HTML, CSS and JS/jQuery. I did this under the guidance of my mentor, Dalibor.

## Problem

The main problem here was really - I didn't know how to code! Getting introduced for the first time to the concept of the web's markup language HTML, CSS basics (positioning, box model, flow, tables, pseudo-classes and -elements, transitions), DOM scripting (events, listeners, bubbling and capturing) was a handful for me.

## Solution

Practice, practice, practice. It was not always easy, as I did this during mornings, nights, and weekends, while working a full time job, but thanks to the pressure of having a weekly skype meeting with my mentor, I knew I just had to. It helps - even for things that you actually *want* to learn!

## Results

The results showed most clearly during assignments, when I was asked to implement certain simple functionality on my own. Realizing that I was capable to do so was very motivating.

## Conclusion

Even for someone who has never coded in their life before, it is actually possible to learn it. Slowly. Step by step. It will take time if it's not the main thing you are focusing on. But, with the right curriculum and time investment, it's possible.
