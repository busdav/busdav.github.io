I've now completed the frontend part of the online coding course that I'm currently doing. Let's revisit what I've learnt so far.

First, of course, the basics of frontend: HTML, and CSS. I'm now able to put together the frontend of a website and make it look like it hasn't been drawn by a toddler. Including actually, making a webpage responsive. Simultaneously, I've been learning the fundamentals of programming, using JavaScript. Loops, Booleans, comparisons, conditionals, array and object manipulation, maps, filters, closures, you name it.
Using these skills, I've of coursed delved into DOM manipulation, using "VanillaJS", but also jQuery. Since I've built a music player, I've integrated the Buzz library. Finally, I've learnt how to deploy a static HTML/CSS/JS website.

However, I've also started to work with AngularJS, learning about modules, dependency injection, data binding, declarative programming, providers, services, controllers, directives, states, and templates. I've integrated the Firebase database,  the Angular Cookies module, and created modals using UI Bootstrap.

Of course, I know my way around the command line and Git/Github. I've started to create my own portfolio using Jekyll and Markdown. I've looked into industry verticals and coding skills most in demand for such verticals. I've started to approach and tackle problems from a coding perspective, which is a different kind of thinking than the lawyer's way of thinking. I've asked countless questions in order to really understand why something worked in a certain way. I've come up with the discipline to do this (uhmâ€¦pretty much) daily, in the morning or in the night, besides my full-time job. I've kept the joy about learning a new skill.

What's next? I'll tell you in my next post. I'm about to dive into Ruby and Rails, i.e., the backend part of my program. Stay tuned.
