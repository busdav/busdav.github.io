title: What does a lawyer like about coding
---
And by lawyer, I mean myself :). I'm making this up as I'm writing it, but really, it is about two things:

One, lawyering and coding are very close to each other. What I mean by 'lawyering' in this context is the core "legal" way of work, i.e., the process of subsuming.

> Subsuming is generally defined as the process by which one concept is subordinated to another. In law, the term is understood as the application of a legal norm to a real-life event, that is, subordinate the real-life facts of a case under the conditions of an applicable norm.

By way of example, let's say Company A is trying to sell a widget to Company B for $600 ( = real-life facts). Will the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") apply to that transaction? To answer this question, we need to look at the requirements of the UCC. Broadly speaking, the UCC states that it will apply to the sale of movable things that are identifiable at the time of contract for $500 or more ( = norm). If we now subsume the facts under the norm ( = process of subsuming), we realize that the UCC *will* apply to our transaction. And how do we know? By applying the norm's "if, then" statement. 

Now, coding is, in a way, similar. You get a problem, i.e., a set of facts:  the requirements for a certain feature we want to implement. For example, the "play" button of a music player needs to show as "pause" button whenever a song is playing. Now, in order to implement such a feature, the requirements need to be subsumed to the norms set by the programming language we're working with - in many cases, using "if, then" statements.

Two, and this is the big advantage that I see in coding vs. the legal way of work, at the end of the day, by coding, you're creating something. You're creating something that is a product, something that works, and will continue to provide value. Whereas, in the legal work, you may have created a contract that works as expected, sure - but the value of such a work product is not as palpable. Actually, you create a contract in the hope that all the rights and obligations that you lay out in the contract will never have to be actively invoked, because the parties act as expected. Whereas, in coding, you very much expect the product that you're building to be used as much as possible.

This act of creation for me is the biggest difference in a way, and is what motivated me to start learning how to code in the first place. This will also allow me to go more into the direction of "hacking the law", something that I hear more and more often. "How can we change and improve the way the law is practiced these days by applying technology?" is the question that's often asked. Well, without any technical knowledge, you'll have no other possibility than to engage with a technical person to implement all those "hacking the law" ideas. However, if you're proficient enough to at least cobble together something, this allows you to build a first prototype, which makes it much easier to test whether an idea you might be having is something that could work or not.

So, there you have it:). Whether you had ever been interested or not, now you know what a lawyer, one lawyer, likes about coding.
